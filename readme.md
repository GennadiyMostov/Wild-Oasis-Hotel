#The Wild Oasis

About Me:

Entry-level web/software development enthusiast and dedicated self-learner with a focus on Javascript, Node/Express, MongoDB/Mongoose, React, and HTML/CSS. A former Engineman First Class in the military, I've transitioned my passion towards the dynamic world of web development. Over the past year, I have dedicated a minimum of 8 hours a day, 5-6 days a week, to intensive self-study, supplemented by a brief but impactful tenure at Hack Reactor bootcamp. Leveraging a diverse array of learning resources including The Odin Project, Udemy, LeetCode, and CodeWars, and various books on CS, I have honed my skills and cultivated a strong foundation in web development. My commitment to continuous improvement, akin to the growth mindset instilled by my military background, is a testament to my perserverence and adaptability. Now, I am actively seeking a stimulating and challenging entry-level position or internship in web development to further amplify my expertise and contribute to innovative projects. My desire to thrive in this dynamic industry and learn under the guidance of experienced mentors is a driving force in my search for employment. My military experience has endowed me with a high-level work ethic and an ability to thrive in collaborative environments, making me an ideal candidate for a future in web/software development.
