#The Wild Oasis

About Me:

Navy Veteran who's on a mission to shift my mechanical background into the exciting realm of Web and software development. For a bit over a year now (as of August 11, 2023), I've been immersing myself in self-guided learning. From Udemy to a quick but impactful run with Hack Reactor, and even embracing challenges on LeetCode. These resources have been my trusty sidekicks, helping me level up my skills.

The project you're checking out was created as part of an exceptionally well-structured React course by Jonas Schmedtmann. It has deepened my grasp of Javascript, but also provided great insights into React. It covered, in depth, React fundamentals and advanced design patterns, encompassing compound components and the context/reducer pattern for robust state management, among other many other concepts. Through this course I gained a very solid foundation with libraries like Redux and React Query and a good understanding of when/why/how they are used.

Thanks for dropping by and taking a tour of my site!
